It seems writing is going to save me.

My mind is a raging ocean that often takes the form of a calm pond on the surface, but you wouldnâ€™t want to take a plunge in it without caution.

Writing might be the thing that saves me and helps me give structure to the raging storm I have upstairs.

Writing on the internet is something that has always interested me. Iâ€™ve had my hand full of blogs from Blogger by Google (remember Blogger ðŸ˜…) to Wordpress and the early Medium days, and now on Twitter or this website.

Writing is something that has always attracted me to my tribe and has always come to my aid during pivotal shifts in my life. When I was depressed and lonely, writing saved me. Could it save me again?

Iâ€™ve spent the last 6ish years navigating the waters of being a creator on the internet, building brands, products, and also starting a YouTube channel. But time and time again, Iâ€™m brought back to face the reality that I just need to write more. But why?

Basically, most of the content on the internet is text or can be converted from text.

Want to post more on Twitter or LinkedIn? Itâ€™s mostly text. Want to make a good YouTube video? You're gonna need a script. Want to start a newsletter? You need to write. Want to rank on Google and get free traffic? You guessed it, you have to write.

In reality, I actually enjoy writing. I just havenâ€™t been consistent with it in the past couple of years, but maybe that's about to change.

I created the website to be a central place for all my writings, and as I approach the end of my isolation era, I hope to post more of my thoughts on here.

What do I aim to achieve with this? Basically all of the above, as well as building up my personal brand and encouraging others who might also want to pursue their journey.

So, is writing going to finally save me and give me the financial freedom, stability, and brand Iâ€™m seeking to have? Well, I just have to write more and find out.

Thanks for reading.
