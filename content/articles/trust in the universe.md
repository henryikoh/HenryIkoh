I've come to the realization that most humans are living 2 different lives: one life which focuses on the physical and one life which focuses on the spiritual. While the end goal is to integrate both these, I find that the majority focus more and value more the physical, while a few, like myself, value and focus more on the spiritual side first.

Everyone is running around and chasing earthly accomplishments and status without first feeding and understanding their soul. Then they wake up at 35-45 and wonder what the hell they have been doing all their lives.

On the flip side, you can spend a lot of time discovering yourself and your passions, while everyone can consider you to be a loser or someone who is lazy or doesn't know what they want in life for not following the path they assume is the correct path you should be following.

Both approaches have their different positives and negatives, but I find it funny when people who only focus on the physical think they can shame or clown on someone who is truly doing the spiritual work because they don't yet have any physical accomplishments, failing to look in the mirror and realize that all their accomplishments truly don't even mean anything in the grand scheme of life. For what does it benefit a man to inherit the world but lose his soul?

I think people overcomplicate life and truly just want to make life more difficult than it needs to be. Everyone is running off a constant fearful energy of what could go wrong in the future, knowing fully well we have 0 control over the future and in fact the future isn't even real. All that we have is the present moment.

All the resources we need for life have been given to us freely by the universe; everything else is simply a want and not a need. People stack their lives up with things that they don't even need, get into marriages with people they don't love, and do things that don't feed their soul, and all around live a life that, though it might seem glamorous, is completely soul-crushing and they truly, truly hate their lives. So what really did these people gain? Just a fleeting feeling of accomplishment that never gets remembered.

While I can understand playing the game of life to win the physical, for me personally the spiritual journey, gift, and rewards have been way more rewarding. Though it is not visible to the naked eye and it can be difficult to notice and get credit for, the ripple effect of these gifts would be felt for generations to come.

I trust in the universe to guide me on my path and to give me the signs I need to make the right decisions.

I trust in the universe to provide for me all I need at the right time and not a second later, to remove the things that are not required in my life and to place new things needed to continue on the journey.

I trust the universe to provide me with the clarity and insight needed to share my gifts with the world when the time is right.

I trust that my steps are guided, and though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I shall do so with a smile on my face because I fear no evil, for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me.

I trust in the Universe.
