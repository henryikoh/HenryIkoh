# Project Overview

**ThinkSenpai** is a Social Impact Design Company based in Lagos, Nigeria that I founded to build a global ecosystem of creative people working together to design a better future for humanity.

What started as a community-driven design initiative has grown into a comprehensive social enterprise that:
- Trains and develops creative technology professionals
- Provides design and development services
- Runs a thriving newsletter and content platform
- Creates opportunities for emerging talent across Africa

## The Vision

I wanted to create more than just another design agency. ThinkSenpai operates as a **social enterprise** - prioritizing community transformation over profit maximization while maintaining financial sustainability. Every project we take on, every person we train, contributes to building better futures.

# The Model: Social Enterprise

ThinkSenpai operates on a social enterprise model:

**Revenue streams:**
- Design and development services
- Training program fees (with scholarships available)
- Corporate partnerships

**Reinvestment into:**
- Scholarships for talented students who can't afford programs
- Community events and resources
- Tools and infrastructure for learning
- Expanding reach across Africa

This model allows us to be financially sustainable while staying true to our mission of transformation over profit.

# Key Learnings

## Building Community Takes Time
Growing to 2,000+ members didn't happen overnight. It required consistent value delivery, authentic relationships, and genuine care for each person's growth.

## Education is Transformation
The best education isn't just about skills - it's about mindset shifts, confidence building, and helping people see their own potential.

## Multiple Hats Work
Being founder, educator, designer, writer, and community leader all at once is challenging but allows for unique integration across everything we do.

## Impact > Scale
Focusing on deep transformation for a smaller group creates more lasting change than surface-level engagement with masses.

# What's Next

ThinkSenpai continues to evolve:
- Expanding the Talent Accelerator to more tracks
- Building partnerships across Africa and globally
- Scaling the social enterprise model
- Creating more pathways for emerging talent
- Continuing to prove that profit and purpose can coexist
