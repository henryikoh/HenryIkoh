# **Project Introduction**

### **The Reasoning for the Project:**

As a creative wanderer for four years, I explored various creative passions, ultimately leading me to product management. The journey started from photography and evolved into design, coding, branding, and marketing. This unique background positioned me as an ideal candidate for a collaboration when Chidi reached out with an app-building opportunity. Intrigued by the idea's potential, I took on the role of a Product Manager.

## **The Problem:**

A significant number of people are either too busy, physically challenged, or simply unwilling to endure the stress of commuting to local markets. These individuals prefer the variety, rates, and quantity of products available in local markets but lack a convenient means to access them. Tradr aims to bridge this gap, providing a solution for their shopping needs from the comfort of their homes.

# **Process**

### **Project Strategy:**

Running strategy sessions is a crucial step in understanding the project's needs and ensuring alignment within the team. It involves breaking down the problem, identifying the target market, and understanding user personas.

### **User Personas:**

- **The Re-seller:**
    - *Needs/Goals:*
        - Buy products in wholesale quantity
        - Build trust and relationships with sellers
    - *Pain Points:*
        - Stress of commuting
        - Limited varieties
        - Higher prices
        - Lack of information about products
    - *How to Help:*
        - Guarantee trust
        - Confirm item purchases
        - Handle the delivery process

(Repeat for Price Comparer and Everyday Buyer)

### **The Idea:**

Tradr envisions a platform where users can experience the benefits of offline market transactions without physically being there. It connects buyers and sellers, facilitating negotiations and transactions through designated shoppers.

### **Assumptions:**

- People prefer major markets for better deals.
- Distance is a barrier, leading to more convenient options.
- Users want a contact in the market for transactions.

### **Questions:**

- Why would users return to the platform after being linked with a seller or shopper?
- Would shop owners release goods before payment?
- If users can pay on delivery, does the shopper need to shop with their money?

### **The Solution:**

Tradr addresses various user needs, focusing on the "everyday buyer" for the initial version. The platform connects individuals with shoppers, ensuring a seamless purchasing experience from local markets, with guaranteed delivery.
